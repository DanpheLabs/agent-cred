Okay, I will integrate these crux in the readme file by make this project narrative as the most secure autonomous wallet and emphasis on technology of htokey and coldkey.

# AgentCred - The Most Secure Autonomous Wallet Infrastructure

AgentCred is designed for AI agents and those who build/manage them, providing a secure, autonomous system for handling payments. Built on the Solana blockchain, AgentCred addresses the need for secure and efficient transactions with a robust hotkey/coldkey architecture, real-time monitoring, and comprehensive analytics. AgentCred empowers you to build and manage AI agents with confidence.

**Live Demo:** [agent-cred.vercel.app](agent-cred.vercel.app)

## üîê Unparalleled Security with Hotkey/Coldkey Architecture

AgentCred's foundation lies in its innovative hotkey/coldkey architecture, providing a multi-layered security approach:

- **Coldkey (Asset Owner):**
    - Holds the primary USDC balance.
    - Receives all incoming payments, ensuring asset accumulation.
    - Approves large transfers and critical operations, maintaining ultimate control.
    - Can update agent settings and deactivate the agent when necessary.

- **Hotkey (Operational):**
    - Operates with a limited daily spending power, minimizing potential damage from compromise.
    - Automates daily operations and payments within defined limits.
    - Cannot modify critical settings or exceed spending limits, enhancing security.
    - Resets every 24 hours, enforcing time-based spending constraints.

This separation of concerns ensures that even if the hotkey is compromised, the coldkey remains secure, safeguarding your assets. It allows for secured wallet as programmatic way with daily spending power.

## üí∞ Key Features

- **Daily Spending Limits:** Automatic reset and approval workflows
- **‚ö° Gasless Transactions:** Recipients don't need SOL for gas fees
- **üì° Real-time Monitoring:** Light client with instant webhook notifications
- **üîå HTTP 402 Protocol:** Standardized payment request protocol
- **üìä Analytics Dashboard:** Track payments, agents, and performance
- **üõ†Ô∏è TypeScript SDK:** Full-featured client library
- **üß™ Comprehensive Tests:** Complete test coverage for smart contracts

Payment Flows
User ‚Üí Agent: Direct USDC to agent's coldkey
Agent ‚Üí Recipient (Auto): Hotkey spends within daily limit
Agent ‚Üí Recipient (Approval): Hotkey requests, coldkey approves

üéÆ Playground
The /payments page provides an interactive playground:

Side-by-Side View: UI form + SDK code examples
Real-time Updates: See code changes as you interact
Copy-Paste Ready: All SDK examples are production-ready
Three Payment Flows: Test all transaction types
Approval System: Simulate coldkey approval workflow

üîë SDK Usage
Installation
npm install agentcred-sdk @solana/web3.js
Initialize SDK
import { AgentCredSDK } from 'agentcred-sdk';
import { Connection, Keypair } from '@solana/web3.js';

const connection = new Connection('https://api.devnet.solana.com');
const sdk = new AgentCredSDK({ 
  connection,
  network: 'devnet' 
});
Register Agent
// Coldkey registers agent with hotkey and daily limit
const signature = await sdk.registerAgent({
  coldkey: coldkeyKeypair,        // Your secure wallet
  hotkey: hotkeyPublicKey,        // Agent's operational wallet
  dailyLimit: 1000                // Maximum daily spending (USDC)
});

console.log('Agent registered:', signature);
Accept Payment
// User pays agent directly
const result = await sdk.payAgent({
  user: userKeypair,
  agentHotkey: hotkeyPublicKey,
  amount: 50,                     // USDC amount
  memo: 'service_xyz'             // Optional service ID
});

console.log('Payment received:', result.signature);
console.log('Explorer:', result.explorerUrl);
Agent Send Payment (Instant)
// Agent spends within daily limit (no approval needed)
const result = await sdk.agentcred({
  hotkey: hotkeyKeypair,          // Agent's operational key
  coldkey: coldkeyPublicKey,      // Agent's asset owner
  recipient: recipientPublicKey,  // Payment destination
  amount: 100                     // USDC amount
});

// Automatically checks daily limit and rejects if exceeded
Request Payment Approval
// For amounts exceeding daily limit
const requestId = await sdk.requestPayment({
  hotkey: hotkeyKeypair,
  coldkey: coldkeyPublicKey,
  recipient: recipientPublicKey,
  amount: 2000,                   // Exceeds daily limit
  purpose: 'Large data purchase'  // Reason (max 200 chars)
});

// Coldkey receives notification and can approve/reject
Webhook Integration
// Handle payment notifications
app.post('/webhook/payment', async (req, res) => {
  const { transaction, amount, sender } = req.body;
  
  // Verify webhook signature
  const isValid = sdk.verifyWebhookSignature(
    req.body, 
    req.headers['x-agentcred-signature'],
    process.env.WEBHOOK_SECRET
  );
  
  if (isValid) {
    // Process payment and deliver service
    await deliverService(sender, amount);
    res.json({ success: true });
  } else {
    res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid signature' });
  }
});
